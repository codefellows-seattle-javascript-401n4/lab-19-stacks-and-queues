For this lab I made a stack constructor and implemented methods to add one to the end of the stack and remove the last one on in the stack, called push and pop. In my queue constructor I added two methods enqueue which adds a value on to the end of the queue and dequeue which removes the first element in the queue. Call npm test in the CLI to run the tests.

For all methods runtime would be O(n).
