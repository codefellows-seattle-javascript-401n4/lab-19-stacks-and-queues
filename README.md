====

## To Submit this Assignment
 * Done

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
<!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  * Done

#### Testing  
  * write at least three test assertions for each method of the Stack and Queue List Data Structures
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

####  Documentation  
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

#### Feature Tasks  
  * implement a Stack constructor
  * implement `push(value)` and `pop()` methods on the Stack prototype
  * implement a Queue constructor
  * implement `enqueue(value)` and `dequeue()` methods on the Queue prototype

## Bonus Points:
  * 2pts
  * implement Reverse Polish Notation using your Stack data structure
    * refer to the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) for more information on RPN
